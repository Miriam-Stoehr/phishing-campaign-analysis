## **Code review**
- good streamlit app, very useful and meaningful
- excellent readme
- good OOP logic
- mail.png and config.json could have been in an assets folder
- good typing and docstring but some docstring missing
- Good job! :fire:




## **Presentation review**
- good quality presentation but some slides could be improved (improvements is a bit crowded)
- missing some visuals for the workflow (api, db, gophish,...)
- no prompt example in the slides but you did show it
- clear explanations
